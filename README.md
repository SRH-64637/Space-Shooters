# 🚀 Space Shooter

Welcome to **Space Shooter**, my very first project in Python! 🎮

This game is a 2D space shooting adventure where players must defeat enemies, avoid obstacles, and survive as long as possible. Built using **Pygame**, it gave me hands-on experience with Python’s libraries, sprites, and event handling.
